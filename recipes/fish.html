        <h2>Blackened Fish</h2>
        <p>This blackened fish is cooked in a hot cast iron pan until charred and packed with flavor. This recipe calls for trout, but catfish or red snapper would be equally good. Be sure to have a well-ventilated kitchen!</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 tablespoon paprika</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons dry mustard</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon black pepper</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon white pepper</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon dried thyme</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1 cup unsalted butter, melted, divided</li>
            <li>6 (4 ounce) fillets trout</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
            <li>Mix together paprika, dry mustard, cayenne pepper, cumin, black pepper, white pepper, thyme, and salt in a small bowl.</li>
            <li>Heat a heavy cast iron pan on high heat until extremely hot, about 10 minutes. While the pan is heating, pour 3/4 cup melted butter into a shallow dish.</li>
            <li>Dip each fillet into butter, turning once to coat both sides.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle both sides of fillets with spice mixture; gently pat mixture onto fish.</li>
            <li>Working in batches, place fillets into the hot pan without crowding. Carefully pour about 1 teaspoon melted butter over each fillet. Cook until fish has a charred bottom, about 2 minutes. Turn fillets and spoon about 1 teaspoon melted butter over each.</li>
            <li>Continue cooking until bottoms are charred, 1 to 2 minutes. Repeat with remaining fish. Serve and enjoy!</li>
